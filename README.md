# Genesis Flutter Build Base Image

This is a base image to build Flutter applications in Genesis ecosystem. The image contains all necessary tools and libraries to be used in Genesis installations.

The key features are:

- [Universal Agent](https://github.com/infraguys/gcl_sdk/wiki/universal_agent) service.
- Genesis root autoresize service. Tries to perform resize of the root partition at every boot if it's possible.
- Genesis bootstrap service. Runs the bootstrap scripts.
- Flutter SDK
- Java (Oracle JDK 21)
- Android SDK (Command line tools)

# üõ†Ô∏è Build

You need [DevTools](https://github.com/infraguys/genesis_devtools) to build the image. See the [install](https://github.com/infraguys/genesis_devtools?tab=readme-ov-file#install) section for details.


Run the build command:

```bash
genesis build -i ~/.ssh/key.pub -f .
```

Where `~/.ssh/key.pub` is your public key for the image.

Also you may set the `GEN_USER_PASSWD` environment variable to change the default user password.

```bash
export GEN_USER_PASSWD=secret
genesis build -i ~/.ssh/key.pub -f .
```

# üöÄ Usage

Upload the image to your repository. Using API, CLI or web interface create a node with the image.

```bash
curl --location 'http://10.20.0.2:11010/v1/nodes/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ****' \
--data '{
    
    "name": "flutter-build-base",
    "project_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "root_disk_size": 50,
    "cores": 1,
    "ram": 1024,
    
    "image": "http://10.20.0.1:8080/gci-flutter-build-base.raw"
}'
```

# üìÉ Bootstrap scripts

For next images in hierarchy you can add scripts that are executed at the very first boot of the node. Actually it can be any executable file and not only bash scripts. Put your scripts in the `/var/lib/genesis/bootstrap/scripts` directory and they will be executed in the order of the files in the directory.
